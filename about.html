        <h2>About Harvard Curling Club</h2>
        <p>Harvard Curling is a university-recognized club sport at Harvard University. We were first established in 2000 and have qualified for every USA College Championship since 2016. Most recently, we placed 4th at the 2022 USA College Curling Championship and the 2017 USA College Curling Championship.</p>

        <p>Our season runs from October through March. During the season, we play local teams and participate in college bonspiels (tournaments) in the Northeast, accumulating points to qualify for the USA College Championship.</p>

        <p>We are always seeking new team members, so get in touch if you are interested in curling with us. We welcome both brand new curlers and experienced curlers looking for more serious competition. Harvard Curling is open to all Harvard students. No experience is necessary to join — we’ll teach you how to curl. We practice and play at Broomstones Curling Club on Fridays from 4:00-6:00. We have transportation available, but if you have access to a car, this would also be a great help for carpooling.</p>

        <p>The club was originally established in 2000, and although it has waxed and waned through the years, we're looking forward to another 20 years of curling.</p>
